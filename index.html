  <h1>FizzBuzz...</h1>
  <p>
    This is a program that shows all numbers between 1 and 100 with the following exceptions:

    <br></br>It shows "Fizz" instead if the number is divisible by 3.<br>

    <br></br>It shows "Buzz" instead if the number is divisible by 5 and not by 3.<br>

<br></br>When it's done, the program shows "FizzBuzz" instead for numbers divisible both by 3 and by 5.<br>
